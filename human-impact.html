						<p>Comparing GRACE and CLM data allows us to disentangle changes in Total Water Storage due to
                        changes in climate from changes due to human actions. If GRACE and CLM data agree, the changes
                        are likely due to climate. If the two sources disagree, the difference is likely due to direct
                        human actions. We show groundwater changes due to human activity in "subtracted" 
                        <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/maps.html">maps</a>.</p>

						<h3>What about human-caused climate change?</h3>
						<p>Human-caused climate change influences groundwater in important ways in the long term. This is modeled, 
                        along with other climate influences, by the Community Land Model. We are most interested in 
                        tracking more direct human actions that influence groundwater. Examples of direct human impacts 
                        include agriculture, industry, household usage, and dam construction. </p>
