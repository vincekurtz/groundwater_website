Source code for the groundwater website is located in /home/stu_phys/groundwater_website.

This is compiled with `jekyll build`. Compiled code goes automatically to the
live website, which is located at /home/groundwater/mypages/ (simlinked to
/home/stu_phys/myGW/). 

Don't try to modify the code on the live website: it will get overwritten.
Instead, the workflow should be as follows:
    - modify source code in /home/stu_phys/groundwater_website
    - run jekyll build
    - observe changes on the live site at
      http://people.goshen.edu/~groundwater
