						<p>The Community Land Model (CLM) is a scientific model of how earth's ecosystems affect the climate.
                        The model tracks and predicts hundreds of variables, including total water storage (TWS).</p>

                        <h3>Details</h3>
						
						<p>The CLM is created by the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR), and is openly availible
                        as a software package. We use this software to extract worldwide TWS data for a variety of time scales.
                        This data represents predictions based on actual conditions at the beginning of a time period. The CLM
                        predicts long term changes in climate such as from changing ecosystems and from human-caused climate 
                        change. It doesn't model direct human impacts on TWS, such as from agricultural usage.</p>
                        
                        <p>You can read more about the CLM on 
                        <a href="http://www.cesm.ucar.edu/models/clm/">their website</a>.</p>
